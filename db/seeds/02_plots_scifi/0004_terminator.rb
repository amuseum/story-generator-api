FRIEND's mother, MENTOR, had been preparing FRIEND for friend_his/her future role as the leader of the human resistance against TRICKSTER, but was arrested after bombing a computer factory. TRICKSTER sends a new robot, SHADOW, back in time to kill FRIEND. SHADOW is an advanced prototype made of a mimetic alloy that allows it to shapeshift and transform parts of its anatomy into knives. SHADOW arrives under a freeway, kills a cop, and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, in the future, FRIEND sends a reprogrammed HERO back for protection.",

    text: "HERO and SHADOW converge on FRIEND in a shopping mall. A chase ensues. FRIEND and HERO escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that SHADOW will kill MENTOR, FRIEND orders HERO to help free MENTOR. They encounter MENTOR as she's escaping from the hospital, although she's reluctant to trust HERO. After the trio escapes from SHADOW in a police car, HERO informs FRIEND and MENTOR about the artificial intelligence that will initiate a nuclear holocaust. MENTOR learns that the person most directly responsible is TRICKSTER, an engineer working on a revolutionary new neural net."

    text: "MENTOR gathers weapons and plans to flee with FRIEND to Mexico, but after having a nightmare, instead sets out to kill TRICKSTER. Finding TRICKSTER at home, mentor_he/she wounds trickster_him/her but is unable to kill trickster_him/her. FRIEND and HERO arrive and learn that TRICKSTER's research has been reverse engineered from the damaged CPU and the right arm of the previous SHADOW. They break into the lab and retrieve the CPU and the arm. The police arrive and TRICKSTER is shot. TRICKSTER manages to trigger several explosives, destroying the lab. SHADOW relentlessly pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in a steel mill."

HERO is seemingly shut down until hero_his/her emergency back-up system brings hero_him/her back online. SHADOW almost kills MENTOR, but HERO shoots SHADOW into a vat of molten metal with a grenade launcher. FRIEND tosses the arm and CPU of the original SHADOW into the vat as well."

    text: "As MENTOR expresses relief that the ordeal is over, HERO explains that in order to ensure that hero_he/she is not used for reverse engineering, hero_he/she must also be destroyed. HERO asks MENTOR to assist in lowering hero_him/her into the vat of metal, since HERO is unable to self-terminate. FRIEND begs HERO to reconsider hero_his/her decision. HERO bids them farewell as hero_he/she is lowered into the vat. HERO gives a tearful FRIEND a final thumbs-up as HERO disappears into the molten steel. MENTOR looks to the future with hope, musing that 'if a machine can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.'"
