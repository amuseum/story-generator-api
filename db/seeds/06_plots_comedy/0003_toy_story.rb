    "text": "In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by six-year-old LOVER, are caught off-guard when LOVER's birthday party is moved up a week, as LOVER, lover_his/her mother, and infant sister Molly, are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and LOVER's favorite toy, a pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff HERO, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, MENTOR, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then LOVER receives a surprise gift â€“ an electronic toy space ranger action figure named TRICKSTER, who thinks trickster_he/she is an actual space ranger."

As LOVER prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, lover_his/her mother allows lover_him/her to bring one toy. Fearing LOVER will choose TRICKSTER, HERO attempts to trap TRICKSTER behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking trickster_him/her out a window, and the other toys rebel against HERO by accusing hero_him/her of knocking TRICKSTER out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, LOVER takes HERO instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, HERO finds that TRICKSTER has hitched a ride on the car as well, and fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where TRICKSTER, still thinking trickster_he/she is a real space ranger, despite HERO's attempts to convince trickster_him/her otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are salvaged by LOVER's mischievous neighbor, SHADOW."

HERO tells TRICKSTER about the joy trickster_he/she can bring to LOVER as a toy, restoring trickster_his/her confidence.
